This thing is currently in pretty messy and in active development.

This thing converts emails in a mailing list to BBS entries. Its features include:

  o Convert attached pictures to inline pictures

  o Upload pictures to the remote LAMP server via FTP/SFTP

  o Organize email threads into BBS topics and replies

  o Very rudimentary categorization of messages

To achieve the aforementioned functionalities, this package depends on jieba and BeautifulSoup 4.

It's been in a test run for about half a year.
